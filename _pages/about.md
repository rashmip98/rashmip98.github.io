Iâ€™m Rashmi Phadnis, a Masters graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, now working as a Deep Learning Research Engineer under [Dr. Lyle Ungar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KCiDjbkAAAAJ).  I'm a problem-solver at heart and I don't shy away from a challenge. I relish the opportunity to break down complex engineering problems and craft innovative solutions. My deep learning and computer vision interests range from segmentation, object detection to generative modeling and human avatar generation. 

While not working, you can find me with my nose buried in a book (preferably sci-fi!), watching anime or embroidering.

I am always open to engaging and collaborating with others, and I am currently seeking full-time roles as a MLE/Computer Vision engineer. Feel free to reach out to me for exciting opportunities, or just to say hi!

A list of my interest/skills:
- PyTorch, Python, C++, CUDA, OpenCV, Blender, sklearn
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- NERFs, Deferred Neural Rendering
- Diffusion Models, GANs, VAEs
- Vision models - U-Nets, Resnets, Vision Transformers, VGG
