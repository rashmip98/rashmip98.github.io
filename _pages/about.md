Iâ€™m Rashmi Phadnis, a Masters graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, now working as a Deep Learning Research Engineer under [Dr. Lyle Ungar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KCiDjbkAAAAJ). My deep learning and computer vision interests range from segmentation, object detection to generative modeling to human avatar generation. 

While not working, you can find me with my nose buried in a book (preferably sci-fi!), watching anime or embroidering.
