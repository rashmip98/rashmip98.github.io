###  UPenn: Research Engineer | PI: Dr. Lyle Ungar
> I'm currently working as a Deep Learning research engineer in the WWBP Lab at UPenn where I lead a team of 2 under Dr. Lyle Ungar and Daniel Kahneman. I'm responsible for deciding the research direction, building and training models, managing data pipelines, evaluating performance of models. The current project is focused on building models of mental representations with respect to person and face perception. An interesting direction we've recently taken is implementing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for convolutional filters. Useful skills learned from this experience are excellent documentation, communication, collaboration. Tools used are PyTorch for the code, Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.
