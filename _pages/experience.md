###  UPenn: Research Engineer | PI: Dr. Lyle Ungar
> I'm currently working as a Deep Learning research engineer in the WWBP Lab at UPenn where I lead a team of 2 under Dr. Lyle Ungar and Daniel Kahneman. I'm responsible for deciding the research direction, building and training models, managing data pipelines, evaluating performance of models. The current project is focused on building models of mental representations with respect to person and face perception. An interesting direction we've recently taken is implementing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for convolutional filters. Useful skills learned from this experience are excellent documentation, communication, collaboration. Tools used are PyTorch for the code, Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.

### Samsung Research America: Deep Learning Research Scientist Intern
> My project dealt with the development of real-time photo-realistic rendering of virtual avatars/virtual humans. This involved conditional GANs, image-to-image translation networks, VAEs, other variants of generative modelling and neural rendering techniques like Deferred Neural Rendering, NeRFs
> I was responsible for the end-to-end research, experimentation, and implementation of the project. This meant I had to read relevant research papers, build production-level research code from the ground up while adhering to good software practices, and curate a high-quality dataset. I had to maintain excellent documentation for presentations to the team and be able to defend every decision. In the end, I developed a small prototype within Blender (something I had never used before) to showcase how the entire pipeline would function. This experience really pushed me to expand my abilities as a programmer and researcher while keeping in mind the deliverables of the final product.
