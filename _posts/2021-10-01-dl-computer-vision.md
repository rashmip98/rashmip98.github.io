tag: project
---

This contains the implementation and training of deep learning models for computer vision tasks like object detection, image segmentation, classification, image generation. The following models are implemented:
- [YOLO](https://github.com/rashmip98/DLforComputerVision/tree/main/YOLO)
- [SOLO](https://github.com/rashmip98/DLforComputerVision/tree/main/SOLO)
- [VAE & GAN](https://github.com/rashmip98/DLforComputerVision/tree/main/VAE-GAN)
- [Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/rashmip98/DLforComputerVision/tree/main/Faster-RCNN)
