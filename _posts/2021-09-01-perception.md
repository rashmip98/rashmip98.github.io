title:  Classical Methods in Perception
tag: project
---

This contains the implementation of classical methods in perception for tasks like 3D reconstruction, two-view & plane-sweep stereo, depth estimation, camera pose estimation. Code for few of the tasks mentioned:
- [3D reconstruction](https://github.com/rashmip98/perception/tree/main/3d_recon-from-2d_images)
- [Two-view & Multi-view Stereo](https://github.com/rashmip98/perception/tree/main/2view_and_multiview_stereo)
- [Depth Estimation](https://github.com/rashmip98/perception/tree/main/depth_estimation_using_optical_flow)
- [P3P & PnP Camera Pose](https://github.com/rashmip98/perception/tree/main/p3p-pnp-for-camera_pose)
